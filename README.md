# java-readline
"Fork" of http://java-readline.sourceforge.net/.

I have imported the CVS repository. Then the project was converted to
Maven. The Makefiles were lightly tweaked to compile on my system,
without any claims of making a portable solution.

TODO: autoconf-iscate the build of the shared libraries. (Help wanted.)
