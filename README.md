# java-readline
"Fork" of http://java-readline.sourceforge.net/.

I have imported the CVS repository. Then the project was converted to
Maven and the Gnu Autotools.

Now deprecated in favor of the [official version](https://github.com/aclemons/java-readline).
(But still, this has Gnu Autotools support; the official version has not;
cf. this [issue](https://github.com/aclemons/java-readline/issues/3).)
